Modified firmware for Hardrock HR-500 RF amplifier.

Major re-write of original code. New features, bug fixes.
Scrapped port change interrupt code and wrote polled code. Removed 1ms timer overflow interrupt which was dominating system realtime. Watchdog implemented.

NEWS: YO6SSW has re-written drivers for the display board to reduce latency. This should improve the bargraph display dynamics substantially.

Version 5.00 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- Changes colour scheme on displays. -- A peak indicator on the bargraph is added. -- Band display text colour changes to match antenna display text colour as a reminder of antenna selection per band as defined in Set\_Theme() colour definitions.

-- 57600 and 115200 Baud added to AccBaud menu. -- Default AccBaud set to 38400. -- Default USB Baud set to 115200.

-- Modem added to XCVR menu. -- Default Band set to 160m. -- Incorporated fault latching ideas from Geert Jan deGroot PE1HZG. Trip condition needs mode press to unlatch.

-- There was a bug in some of the display calculations which had a map() function nested inside a constrain() which is a faux-pas for the arduino compiler. Re-wrote these sections with a simple map(). -- Moving average filters replaced with exponential weighted moving average which is easier to tune.

-- All attempts to make the bar graph lively and dynamic in previous versions met with failure.
The TFT display hardware is just too slow to draw a full bar so the previous code's while loop was eliminated and new code written to only draw a four pixel wide vertical line like the peak indicator.
This works very well. :^>

-- Code edits from PE1HZG to put F/C temperature unit selection in menu system and use of snprintf statements for menu items incorporated in this version. Thank you Geert Jan!

-- Improvements made to VSWR meter routines to improve display dynamic. -- T/R switching routine simplified and moved to top of main loop since many other routines are dependent on TX/RX state. -- Some other niceties like having swr display blank until a valid reading, resetting swr display after changing antennas. Hold swr and fault displays after fault trip. Last vswr appears after drive power removed following a trip.

-- Changed colour references to use different colour variable names which are defined in this header file.

-- Menu item code taken from PE1HZG for temperature unit selection.

-- HRTS command (Temperature units Set) added to serial routines for reading/setting display theme. F = Fahrenheit C = Celsius. Thanks to Geert Jan De Groot PE1HZG.

-- Added menu item for theme selection. Currently only two themes supported NORMAL and NIGHT.
Colour definition can be changed in Set\_Theme() routine. Used 16 bit colour picker from https://rgbcolorpicker.com/565

-- HRDS command (Display Set) added to serial routines for reading/setting display theme. D = day N = night.

-- This version does not use the port change interrupt for PTT sensing but polls the port bit in the main loop and uses a Chronometer for debouncing. Previously there was an occasional glitch if PTT changed while interrupts were disabled. Debounce time is defined in this header file.

-- intSensor() routine modified to be dependent on minimal drive power sensed. This keeps the exponential filters from de-integrating during CW characters and gives more accurate and smoother power display bargraph.

-- Moved carrier detect routines into top of main loop alogside PTT detection and added chronometer for T/R delay to prevent relay wear during fast CW keying with or without PTT signal.

-- Found out needless timer interrupts every millisecond were preventing the freqcount library from operating properly so removed timer interrupt completely.


Version 6.00 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- Added array in memory and in EEPROM for ATU state per band. Amplifier now remembers if ATU is ON/BYP per band.

-- Implemented watchdog timer to reset amp in case of stack overflow or other surprise endings.

-- Changed TX indicator to reflect PTT vs COR activation based on colour

-- Mode text and colour changed.


Version 6.01 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- Fault reset bug fixed.


Version 6.02 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- Small change to touch screen detection.


Version 6.03 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- Minor display tweaks.
-- New subroutine to read power regs from LTC2945
-- Hysteresis added to SWR display


Version 6.04 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- New subroutine sets max DC power threshold registers in LTC2945 power monitor IC
-- and enables max power fault bit in control reg.
-- Max DC power is defined on line 27 on HR\_500\_V6.04.ino file (default 900 watts)

-- DC overpower fault will trip the amp and require drive power to be removed before
-- the amp will reset.  The condition is indicated by red letters "OVER" displayed in
-- DC power display window.  The LTC2945 sample rate is 7.5 Hz so it can interrupt
-- the amplifier Vdd supply in ~133msec.

-- This feature can be used to prevent the operator from going beyond legal limits
-- for example in Canada advanced operators are limited to 1000 watts (DC input) for
-- continuous wave emissions or 700W rf output whichever comes first.
-- Adjust this limit upwards at your own peril.



Version 6.05 Notes. -- VE7VXO

-- Some display tweaks and bug fixes.
-- Improved auto band switching based on frequency detect (amp must be in OFF mode)
-- Remembers last band in use at powerdown and returns to that band on powerup.
-- Tried to speed up RF sensing to improve SWR display with fast CW keying.
-- Some small bugs with ATU display functions not working correctly found and fixed.
-- Bug introduced between Ver.5 and Ver.6 due to inadvertent deletion of instruction
   to drive I/O expander IC chip select line on LPF board. Fixed.
-- T/R routines adjusted to make TX active "LED" panel on right touch screen show
   activity when amp is OFF.

 Version 6.06 Notes. -- VE7VXO

  -- Serial routines for firmware update modified as per PE1HZG to mitigate HobbyPCB
     firmware upload tool connection issues on some windows PC's. 
  -- Eliminated relay chatter due to CW keying when amp is OFF.
  -- Moved Max DC Power define statement (default 1000W) to HR500V1.h line 146.
  -- Added #define TOPBAND in HR500V1.h to enable high power on 160m.  Only uncomment
     this line if you have modified the RF pallet for 160m use!
  -- VDD indicator changes to yellow if VDD < 55v and red if VDD < 50v
  -- Amp trips if VDD > 62.5v
     
 Version 6.07 Notes. -- VE7VXO

  -- Additional hardware protections within the LTC2945 chip implemented for VDD and IDD
  -- This is only for redundancy in addition to existing fault monitoring in software. 
  It may be useful for those experimenting with the code to put lower limits on IDD and max
  DC power incase something goes pear shaped in their code experiments.  Fault indications
  will be displayed in the DC power window.  Imax, Vmax and Pmax will trip the amp. If Vdd
  goes low it will not trip but "Vmin" message will appear in blue in the DC window. This can
  be observed momentarily when power is switched off as caps discharge but display is still working.
  Fault threshold values are defined in HR500V1.h file.

 Version 6.08 Notes. -- VE7VXO

  -- Touchscreen bug fixed.  ATU tuning cancel now works.
  -- Ignores serial ports while tranmitting.
  -- Transmit inhibited outside 160m - 10m range.
    
 Version 6.09 Notes. -- VE7VXO

  -- Menu item added for RF sensing ON/OFF  Selection stored in EEPROM.  RF sensing allows the amplifier to
  autoset band if a continuous carrier is applied for at least 1/2 second while amp mode is OFF.
  -- RF sensing will also do keying without PTT.
  -- RF sensing is a compromise. Due to relay switching any drive RF during the first 50msec of initial detection 
  will be truncated from the amplifier output. This is unavoidable since the VDMOS output transistors must not be
  driven until the amplifier internal relays have switched and settled.  Note that during this time the exciter
  will see undefined load impedance.  Therefore only use RF sensing with an exciter that can tolerate a brief
  high mismatch.  During RF sensing operation VDD for the finals is removed during RX and while switching to TX 
  so it is normal to see VDD at zero and a blue status indicator for VDD during RX in this mode.
  -- FWD power bargraph display improved for low power range. Under 100w output display is estimated from drive power
  assuming 20dB gain.
  -- Added boot warning for COR threshold mal adjusted or RF detected during boot-up.

 Version 7.00 Notes. -- VE7VXO

  Menu item added for T/R hang time which can now be set by the user between 50 to 500msec.  Default is 300msec.
  ATU routine tweaked to require revoval of drive power at end of tune sequence. TX status indicator flashes
  red as a reminder until RF drive is removed.

 Version 7.02 Notes. -- VE7VXO

  The lower left corner of the menu screen where the ATU firmware info is located is now transformed into a
  touchscreen button which brings up an ATU parameter screen. If the current selected band has a valid match
  stored and the current selected antenna matches the one for the stored solution then the parameters on that
  line are highlighted in the colour for that antenna according to the chosen display theme. Otherwise the data
  is grey. Antenna switching and initiating a match are supported from this page using the touchscreen buttons
  on the lower right and center respectively. Exit to the main screen with the button on the lower left.
  This version uses modified ATU firmware Version 2.1 which is included in the repository on Github.
